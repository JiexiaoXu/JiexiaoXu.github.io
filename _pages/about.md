🫡 Hi, I am a combined B.S./M.S. student in Computer Science at the University of Washington.

I am broadly interested in **computer systems** and **computer graphics**. On the systems side, I work on **end-to-end SLO–aware scheduling in microservices**, building schedulers that use end-to-end deadlines and downstream workload estimation to improve goodput under overload. I am fortunate to collaborate with Ph.D. student Shihang Li, advised by Professors [Simon Peter](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~simpeter/) and [Ratul Mahajan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ratul/).

Previously, I worked in the Syfi Lab with Ph.D. student [Yile (Michael) Gu](https://ikace.github.io/) and Professor [Baris Kasikci](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~baris/) on **application-level crash-consistency testing**. We developed a representative testing framework that groups similar crash states to make testing both scalable and accurate, leading to a paper accepted to OOPSLA 2025.

I also enjoy graphics work. Advised by Professor [Gilbert Bernstein](http://www.gilbertbernstein.com/), I am exploring **optimizations to the rendering pipeline in 3D Gaussian Splatting**, such as clustering-based techniques to reduce sorting overhead and improve runtime and memory usage in real-time 3D reconstruction.

In my spare time, I enjoy staying active with tennis rallies and traveling, with a special fondness for trying ice creams at local shops.
