🫡Hi, I am a fourth-year computer science undergraduate at the University of Washington. 

🧐I have broad interests within computer science. My current research focuses on **accelerating the rendering pipeline in 3D Gaussian Splatting**, which enables true real-time 3D reconstruction. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Gilbert Bernstein](http://www.gilbertbernstein.com/) during my undergraduate studies. In addition, I have collaborated with Ph.D. student [Yile (Michael) Gu](https://ikace.github.io/), under the guidance of Professor [Baris Kasikci](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~baris/), working on building tools to detect application-level bugs and enhance system reliability.

🎾In my spare time, I enjoy staying active with tennis rallies and traveling, with a special fondness for trying ice creams at local shops.

🏫**Currently, I am looking for a Ph.D. position starting in Fall 2025. Please reach out if you are interested or have any opportunities!**
